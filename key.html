        <strong>Cool Biz </strong> <br>Proper Room Temperature</h2>
      <article class="keyContent">
        <p>
          Since the year 2005, the Ministry of the Environment has been promoting a lifestyle called "COOLBIZ" that encourages people to dress lightly and take measures to stay comfortably without relying too heavily on excessive air conditioning in order to combat global warming.
          <br><br>
          Now, let's discuss what is meant by the recommended room temperature of "28°C" in the context of "COOLBIZ". In this context, 28°C refers to an upper limit guideline for room temperature, not the setting on an air conditioner remote control. In other words, it doesn't mean that you must always set the room temperature to 28°C. Factors such as outdoor temperature and humidity during air conditioning, the building's conditions like its orientation to the sun and the type of air conditioning system, as well as individual variations in perceived temperature, should all be taken into account. We ask that you manage the room temperature within a comfortable range, considering the health of those inside and avoiding excessive cooling.
          <br><br>
          First and foremost, we encourage you to prioritize health and flexibly adjust the temperature of your air conditioner, using it appropriately.</p>

        <h4>Background of Setting the Recommended Room Temperature to "28°C"
        </h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          When "COOLBIZ" started in the year 2005, it was based on the temperature range specified in the "Regulations Concerning the Maintenance of Hygienic Environment in Buildings" and the "Office Hygiene Standards" under the Ordinance of the Act on the Maintenance of Hygienic Environment in Buildings and the Industrial Safety and Health Act (above 17°C and below 28°C at that time). We have been advocating for a room temperature of 28°C during air conditioning based on these regulations.</p>

      What Is Warm Biz?
      </h2>
      <article  class="keyContent">
        <p>
          WARM BIZ is a lifestyle promoted by the Ministry of the Environment as one of the measures against global warming during the winter season. It encourages maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature of 20°C (recommended) without relying excessively on heating.
          <br><br>
          The government has set a policy to lead by example, aiming to adjust indoor temperatures during heating to approximately 19°C, ensuring that it doesn't become excessive. Local government entities are also requested to cooperate in similar efforts.

          Reducing CO2 Emissions Through Heating Usage to Prevent Global Warming!
          <br><br>
          The purpose of WARM BIZ is to reduce CO2 emissions and prevent global warming by decreasing the energy consumption required for heating.</p>
          <img src="image/無題 (6).png" alt="image Popping up." class="imgPopup">
          <br><br>
          <p>Generally, it is known that adjusting indoor temperature settings can lead to more significant energy savings in the winter compared to the summer when using electric heating and cooling. Lowering the temperature setting during heating in the winter not only has a CO2 reduction effect but also effectively reduces electricity bills. WARM BIZ offers economic benefits for both households and offices.
          <br><br>
          In modern, well-insulated buildings, indoor temperatures can sometimes exceed 20°C without the need for heating. Such buildings contribute directly to mitigating global warming through their performance. While WARM BIZ encourages a 20°C indoor temperature, it does not advocate cooling such buildings to 20°C by using air conditioning when it is not necessary.
          <br><br>
          If it's possible to avoid using heating altogether, that's the most desirable scenario. WARM BIZ is an initiative that simply encourages appropriate heating usage.

      <br>
      What is Eco-Driving?
      </h2>
      <article  class="keyContent">
      <p>Eco-driving is a driving technique that emphasizes patience and gentle handling. It involves gradually accelerating and braking, as well as maintaining a comfortable distance between vehicles. Each of these actions may seem like small steps on their own, but when practiced consistently, they can lead to significant results.
        <br><br>
        If drivers in Japan and around the world all work together on this, it will undoubtedly become a powerful force. This approach can reduce the environmental impact and decrease the number of traffic accidents, ultimately contributing to the happiness and well-being of both you and the people around you.</p>
        <br><br>
      <img src="image/無題 (3).png" alt="image Popping up." class="imgPopup">
      <br><br>
      <h4>10 Recommendations for Eco-Driving</h4>
      <p>Eco-driving is a set of driving techniques and principles aimed at reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, contributing to the prevention of global warming. Additionally, eco-driving leads to a reduction in traffic accidents. Driving with low fuel consumption not only benefits your wallet but also provides a safe and reassuring experience for passengers. It's important to drive with a sense of composure and with time to spare.
        <br><br>
        Eco-driving is an action that anyone can start right away. By turning small conscious efforts into habits, you can improve your driving, and undoubtedly, society as a whole will benefit.</p>

      What "Smart Move"?
      </h2>
      <article   class="keyContent">
      <p>"Smart Move" in terms of eco-friendliness typically refers to making intelligent and environmentally conscious choices in transportation and mobility. 
        <br><br>
        This can involve various practices and technologies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of transportation, such as using public transit, carpooling, biking, walking, or using energy-efficient vehicles. It may also encompass the adoption of smart technologies and apps that optimize routes, reduce fuel consumption, and promote sustainable transportation options. 
        <br><br>
        The goal of a "Smart Move" approach is to minimize emissions, congestion, and resource consumption while maximizing efficiency and convenience in transportation.</p>
      <img src="image/無題 (5).png" alt="image Popping up." class="imgPopup">
      <p>"Global warming (climate change) is having a serious impact on our lives. 
        <br><br>It is highly likely that human activities are the major contributors to this warming. To halt global warming, it is essential to reconsider our daily actions in life. 
        <br><br>Especially, reevaluating 'transportation' is crucial, as emissions from transportation account for about one-fourth of our overall lifestyle. Why not choose eco-friendly transportation methods and challenge yourself to minimize emissions? 
        <br><br>This not only contributes to being 'eco,' but also to 'health,' 'comfort,' and more. It's time to start this new lifestyle, Smart Move. <strong>

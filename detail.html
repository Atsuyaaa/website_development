                <div class="detailStil">"What are the attractions of a 'workation' in Nikko National Park?</div>
                <br>
                <div class="detailP">
                  <p>
                    Nikko National Park is a pioneer in the world of 'workations'. This is because Itamuro Onsen within the park implemented the government's workation demonstration project in 2021, and has been making progress in facilities such as Wi-Fi environments in accommodations and outdoor public Wi-Fi. They have established comfortable communication environments where you can work from anywhere, be it indoors or outdoors. While Itamuro Onsen has been a beloved hot spring destination with a long history, one of its current charms is the ability to achieve a work style in harmony with nature, known as 'Itamuro Workation'.
                  </p>
                  <br><br>
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, both the Itamuro Onsen area and the Shiohara Onsen area within Nikko National Park were registered as 'Zero Carbon Parks' by the Ministry of the Environment in 2021. A 'Zero Carbon Park' is an initiative promoted by the ministry as an area that takes a lead in decarbonization within national parks. Itamuro Onsen and Shiohara Onsen are the first areas in Tochigi Prefecture and the third in the country to be registered. They are actively working on creating sustainable tourism destinations, utilizing hot spring waste heat, improving the efficiency of hot spring supply facilities, utilizing electric autonomous buses, and reducing plastic waste.
                  <br><br>
                  By choosing to have your workation in Nasushiobara City, you can experience these advanced efforts in decarbonization up close.
                  <br><br>
                  Furthermore, Nasushiobara City is known for its thriving dairy farming, agriculture, and tourism industries, with numerous shops and restaurants. After work, you can savor delicious meals at restaurants, enjoy shopping, and, of course, relax in hot springs. This unique combination of workation possibilities is a distinct advantage offered by Nasushiobara City."</p>

            <h2 class="detailTil">Do you know effective methods for ventilating while keeping the room temperature warm?</h2>
            <article class="p-5">
              <p>
                <div  class="detailStil">Points for Winter Ventilation at Home:</div>
                <br>
                <div  class="detailP">
                  <p>
                    The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recommends ventilating while maintaining a room temperature of 18 degrees Celsius or above and humidity of 40% or higher. It's said that viruses become more active in cold and dry environments. Based on various research results, it's understood that room temperature can impact health, and the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends maintaining a temperature of 18 degrees Celsius or higher. It's also noted that when humidity falls below 40%, virus activity tends to increase.
                  </p>
                  
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    To maintain room temperature, instead of opening windows in the room you're currently in, you can open windows in unoccupied rooms to let in outside air, and slightly open the door to ventilate. This method, called "two-stage ventilation," allows outside air to pass through other rooms and warm up slightly before entering the room you're in. This is effective for maintaining room temperature.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4> Effective Use of Heating Appliances During Ventilation:</h4>
                 <br>
                  <p>
                    Placing heating appliances near open windows is effective. This way, cold air from outside is quickly warmed, making it less likely for the room temperature to drop. However, if you're using a stove or similar heating appliance, be cautious not to place it too close to flammable items like curtains.
                  
                    Replacing with an air conditioner equipped with a ventilation function, allowing you to heat while ventilating, is also an option.
                  </p>
                
                  <br>
                  <h4> Are there energy-efficient heating appliances available? Additionally, what are some effective ways to use an air conditioner?</h4>
                 <br>
                  
                  As energy-efficient methods for heating a room, there are heat pump-type air conditioners and underfloor heating. A heat pump gathers heat from the outside air with minimal energy, compresses it, and converts it into a larger amount of thermal energy. In other words, this helps reduce both energy costs and CO2 emissions.</p>

              "Do you know tips for staying warm in the cold winter while being eco-friendly and energy-efficient?"</h2>
            <article class="p-5">
              <div  class="detailStil">"How did you manage to get through last winter without using heating?</div>
              <br>
              <div class="detailP">
                <p>
                  Our apartment is well-sealed, and the south-facing living room gets quite warm on sunny winter days due to the sun's heat. Around 3:00 PM when the sun starts to set, we close the heavy curtains to block out the cold air from outside.
                  <br><br>
                  We put rugs on the floor to keep our feet from getting cold. Additionally, we made efforts to warm up our bodies to the core during bath time.
                  <br><br>
                  The key to staying warm and energy-efficient is 'Warm Share' and 'Warm Biz', as well as spending quality time together as a family. This means, when at home, instead of each family member using heating in their individual rooms, we gather in one room like the living room and adopt a new energy-efficient style of living. This way, we only need to heat and light up one room.
                  <br><br>
                  'Warm Biz' involves adjusting perceived temperature through clothing, like wearing an extra layer. For instance, it's said that wearing socks increases perceived temperature by +0.6°C, putting on a cardigan raises it by +2.2°C, and using a lap blanket raises it by +2.5°C.
                  <br><br>
                  Humidity is also important. Raising humidity levels can increase perceived temperature. In our home, after family members finish bathing, we leave the bathroom door open to humidify the air with the bathroom's moisture. There are many ways to do this with items already in the house, without needing special equipment."</p>

            <h2 class="detailTil">"Utilizing, Not Discarding! Learning from the Lifestyle of the Edo Period"</h2>
            <article class="p-5">
              <div class="detailStil">"Learning from the Edo Era: Making the Most of Resources and Living Sustainably"</div>

              <div  class="detailP">
                <p>

                  The issue of waste management remains a challenge in densely populated areas, both in the past and today. During the Edo period, cities like Edo (now Tokyo) were home to many people, leading to a significant amount of waste generation. However, the Edo period featured a robust system of recycling and reuse.
                  <br><br>
                  For instance, specialized paper waste collectors would buy used paper materials and sell them to papermakers for recycling. Additionally, ash from household stoves was collected by ash buyers and repurposed. Other waste, such as human waste, was transported to nearby rural areas and used as fertilizer. This local recycling loop allowed Edo to produce regional specialties like Nerima radishes, Komatsuna spinach, and Takinogawa burdock, benefiting local farmers economically.
                  <br><br>
                  In the Edo period, there was no culture of disposable items. Skilled craftsmen, such as "Ikakeya" (repairers of pots and kettles) and "Tagaya" (barrel and tub repairers), repaired and maintained various tools, extending their lifespans.
                  <br><br>
                  Today, disposing of large amounts of waste through incineration requires significant energy. By emphasizing recycling and reuse, we can reduce waste, consequently reducing energy consumption. The Edo people's wisdom and innovations of not discarding items prematurely and making the most of available resources are lessons we can apply in modern times.
                  <br><br>
                  One example is the use of "furoshiki" cloth. While the use of eco-bags has become more common as a way to reduce plastic bag usage, there is a renewed interest in furoshiki. Furoshiki can wrap items of various shapes, and some are made from recycled materials like PET bottles. Cotton and polyester furoshiki can be washed and reused multiple times, aligning with an eco-friendly lifestyle.
                  <br><br>
                  To reduce waste, some households have adopted home composting systems that use microorganisms to break down kitchen scraps into compost. These composters come in various types, including bio and hybrid models, suitable for different needs and spaces. Using homemade compost to grow vegetables and returning kitchen scraps to the compost pile creates a small-scale circular economy. Reducing the amount of waste sent for incineration contributes to lower carbon emissions.
                  <br><br>
                  In the Edo era, thriftiness and reusing items were common practices. Many Edo citizens bought secondhand clothing from used clothing stores, promoting recycling. Borrowing items, like bedding for different seasons, was also customary, contributing to resource conservation. This practice of sharing items is akin to today's sharing economy, emphasizing minimal production and waste reduction.
                  <br><br>
                  As we learn from the Edo people's energy-efficient and eco-friendly lifestyle, there are many actions we can take in modern times. By adopting a mindset of not discarding items prematurely, utilizing resources efficiently, and promoting reuse and recycling, we can work towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly society.</p>
